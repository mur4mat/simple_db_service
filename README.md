# R Developer task

Write a simple database service for storing information about music bands and their members.
Users should be able to:
- add bands and musicians,
- define relationships (a musician has played in a band, a musician has played with another musician, two bands have played together),
- retrieve related bands/musicians.
 
User interface can be any of: a REST API, an R/Python/etc. API, a command-line tool, a GUI, etc.
You can choose whichever technologies suit you best.
 
Bonus points for:
- making your service portable (e.g., Dockerizing it),
- supporting distinct historical/present relationships (e.g., Blaze Bayley sang with Iron Maiden in the 90's, but now Bruce Dickinson is the singer),
- justifying your choice of technologies.
